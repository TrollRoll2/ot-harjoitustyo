## Purpose of the project

The project will handle the topic of video games. I will begin by making a video game that keeps track of different users' high scores. I will also possible create several (a couple) of games that keep separate high scores and has a leaderboard, but I will see which direction the project takes as the course progresses.

## Functionality

The project will offer the possiblity to play games without logging in, but this will not track personal highscores. The top scores can, however, still be registered to the leaderboard by entering a name after the game (if the score is a high score).

The leaderboards for the game(s) will be viewable for any user.

Users can also register and log into their account. When logged in, the account's high scores will be visible and the user's points are automatically registered.

If I have extra time I will implement a second or third simple game, and possibly implement a personalized account page where users can view their own scores and statistics.
