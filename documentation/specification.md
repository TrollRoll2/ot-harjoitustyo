## Purpose of the project

The project ended up being only a single game. After a final effort the game is functional and customisable and offers the user a simple layout and gameplay. The users score is also tracked in a database, and the best scores are displayed.

## Functionality

The application begins by leading the user to a main menu. The main menu consists of a list of highscores and 3 buttons. The first button allows the player to start the game. After the game is over, the user is prompted to enter a name in order to track the score in the leaderboard. The user can choose not to save their score by leaving the name field empty. Upon entering a name and saving the users' score, the score is saved in a database.

The second button allows the user to enter the options menu. In the options menu the user can modify the rules of the game, by adjusting the speed at which the player or the squares move, the amount of growth the player recieves upon consuming smaller squares, and the ratio of which new squares spawn. The options are immediately updated and show the current value.

The last button is a simple exit button which allows the user to exit the game.
